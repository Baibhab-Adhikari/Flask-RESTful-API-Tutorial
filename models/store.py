    # This sets up a relationship where each store can have many items.
    # You can access all items in a store using 'store.items'.
    # The 'back_populates="store"' part tells SQLAlchemy this relationship is connected to
    # the 'store' property in the ItemModel â€” this links both directions (two-way connection).
    # The 'lazy="dynamic"' part means the related items are not loaded immediately with the store.
    # Instead, you get a query object that lets you filter or load items only when needed.
    # Example: store.items.all() will fetch all items in the store.
